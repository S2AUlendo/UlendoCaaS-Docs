# An overview of the results 
During and after calibration process a series of charts are generated.

# First Step
As the first step, the plugin generates a self-test for the accelerometer. This test is done to ensure that the accelerometer is securely wired to the attached Raspberry Pi.

If the accelerometer was successfully connected to the Raspberry Pi, the user interface will display a short graph followed by success message. 

## Supported Accelerometers
At launch, only the ADXL345 is supported. However, other newer models will be supported in the near-future.
