# Advanced Settings
For expert users a number of advanced settings are provided. These can be accessed from the settings menu in the OctoPrint interface. 

A default set of parameters are provided which should work for the majority of common desktop printers. However, for larger machines, or machines which are less prone to mechanical vibration it may be necessary to tune the advanced parameters in the plugin.

> Adjusting these settings may result to unwanted behavior from the machine. Adjust these settings at your own risk. Incorrectly configured settings may result in damage to you or your machine.
