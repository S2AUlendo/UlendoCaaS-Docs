# Troubleshooting the CaaS C3 Device

Note that the product is in beta and may have issues. 
**Users should navigate or swipe right on the device screen to look at the terminal, which will output error messages.**

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Device Stuck in Power On and Off Loop
If the device is constantly stuck in a power on and off loop:
- Connect the device to a computer to see if it turns on.
- If it does, try powering it on again without the computer, and it may fix itself.

### 2. Device Disconnected and Fails to Reconnect to Cloud Service
If the device becomes disconnected and fails to reconnect to the cloud service:
- Press the reset button, which is the bottom button of the device, to reset the device.

### 3. USB of the Printer Not Detected
If the USB of the printer can't be detected on the device:
- The firmware running on the printer might not be supported.
- Contact Ulendo for help when these problems occur.

### 4. Reset and Reinstall Firmware
If you need a fresh start, you can use the firmware flasher tool to reset and then reinstall the firmware on your C3 device:
