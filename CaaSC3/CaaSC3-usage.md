# Usage Overview
The **Connectivity Control Collaboration (C3)** device is a versatile tool designed to enhance your 3D printing experience. This page provides an overview of the key features and functionalities available through the C3 device and the CaaSUI dashboard.

## Input Shaper Calibration
Optimize your 3D printer's performance with the **Calibration as a Service** feature:

1. **Axis Selection:** Run a sweep calibration on the X or Y axis of your printer.
2. **Data Analysis:** The collected data helps identify and mitigate resonance issues, improving print quality.
3. **Automation:** The process is streamlined, and the results are directly applied for enhanced accuracy.

> The calibration process takes a few minutes. Ensure the printer is free of obstacles during this operation.

## Real-Time Temperature Monitoring
Track your printer's temperature statistics in real time using the **Statistics Card:**

- **Hotend Temperature:** Monitor the current and target temperatures of the hotend.
- **Bed Temperature:** View the live and target temperatures of the printer bed.
- **Live Graph:** Quickly assess your printer's thermal performance history at a glance.

## Control Pad
Control your printer effortlessly with the **Control Pad**, offering:

- **Movement Commands:** Move the print head and bed along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Fan Control:** Start or adjust the printer’s fan settings.
- **Custom Commands:** Execute additional printer actions with a simple, gamepad-like interface.

> Always ensure the build area is clear before executing movement commands.

## File System Management
Access and manage files stored on your printer’s SD card directly through the C3 interface:

1. **View Files:** Browse the list of available G-code files.
2. **Start Prints:** Select a file and start the printing process remotely.
3. **File Details:** Check file properties and organization.

## Terminal Access
For advanced users, the **Terminal** provides direct access to the printer’s serial monitor:

- **Send Commands:** Input G-code or other commands directly to your printer.
- **View Feedback:** Monitor the printer’s responses and status callbacks in real time.
- **Debugging:** Diagnose issues efficiently with comprehensive terminal logs.
